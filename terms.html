                <strong>RESTRICTING LICENCE RIGHTS</strong>
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited license as described further below (such limited license to be referred to herein as a “Restricted License”).  You may make this election by selecting such Restricted License grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the license terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard License”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard License to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard License), but shall be granted a “Restricted License” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: 
            <ol>
                <li>When you post your Content to the Services, the license you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate, and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted License applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g., a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services.</li>
                <li>As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted License, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ license rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services.  Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ license rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted License by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time.</li>
                <li>The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others.  In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content.</li>
                <li>The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made "public" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services.</li>
                <li>Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The license you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted License”.</li>
                <li>For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programs is not subject to the Restricted License, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or program.</li>
